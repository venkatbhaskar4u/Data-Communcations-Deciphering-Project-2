# Practical Digital Communications Decoding

## Overview
This project provides a hands-on workflow for decoding digital communications data from raw signal samples using Python. It demonstrates real-world techniques for processing, thresholding, and reconstructing binary messages embedded in analog waveformsâ€”all implemented within an interactive Jupyter Notebook.

## Key Features
- **Signal Analysis:** Reads and visualizes raw sample data to locate preambles and symbol start points.
- **Adaptive Decoding:** Employs algorithmic threshold setting, segmentation, and symbol conversion to handle realistic data irregularities.
- **Binary Message Extraction:** Converts decoded bits into byte arrays, then into readable ASCII text.
- **Error Handling:** Includes steps for validation and correction of output messages, useful for noisy and imperfect channels.
- **Reproducible Notebook Workflow:** Entire process is documented and executable for learning, teaching, or reuse.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas, NumPy

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/venkatbhaskar4u/Data-Communcations-Deciphering-Project-2.git`
2. Place a compatible signal file (e.g., text file with numerical samples) in your local environment.
3. Open `Edited.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and update the file path.
4. Run all notebook cells to process, decode, and print the final ASCII message.

## Example Results
- Recovers text from a simulated or real-world communications signal.
- Validates digital decoding strategy with the original embedded message.

## Applications & Impact
- Relevant in academic research, telecom education, embedded systems, and IoT signal processing.
- Demonstrates practical signal decoding and low-level protocol recovery skills for data science and engineering roles.
